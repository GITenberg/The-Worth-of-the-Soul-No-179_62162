<h1><span class="GutSmall">THE</span><br />
WORTH OF THE SOUL.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> soul of every man is of more
worth to him than all the world.&nbsp; What would it profit him,
if he were to gain the whole world, were he thereby to lose his
own Soul?&nbsp; Such is the uncertainty of life, he might not
long enjoy his power, his riches, and his pleasures.&nbsp; If he
could possess all these, with health and friends, and live to
very old age, an eternity then succeeds, and all that is past is
but as a tale that is told, or as a dream of the night.&nbsp; For
a small portion of the things of time men are all activity and
life.&nbsp; They are ingenious in managing their trades, careful
in preserving their health, and watchful in securing their
property.&nbsp; But should the care of the Soul be
overlooked?&nbsp; Should the health of the Soul be
neglected?&nbsp; Should the future happiness of the Soul be
disregarded?&nbsp; How many have lost their Souls through
<i>ignorance</i>, <i>impenitence</i>, <i>unbelief</i>,
<i>disobedience</i>, <i>fleshly lusts</i>, <i>love of the
world</i>, <i>fear of man</i>, <i>love of ease</i>, <i>or some
profitable or pleasant sin</i>, <i>or neglect of the great
salvation</i>; <i>yet how plain and decided are the oracles of
God on all these points</i>.&nbsp; Observe each in its
order.&nbsp; On the subject of <i>ignorance</i>, it is said,
&ldquo;My people are destroyed for lack <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of knowledge; because thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee.&rdquo; (Hos. iv.
6.)&nbsp; Of <i>impenitence</i>, &ldquo;Except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish.&rdquo; (Luke xiii. 3.)&nbsp; Of
<i>unbelief</i>, &ldquo;He that believeth not the Son, shall not
see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.&rdquo; (John iii.
36.)&nbsp; Of <i>disobedience</i>, &ldquo;To them who are
contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
he will render indignation and wrath.&rdquo; (Rom. ii. 8.)&nbsp;
Of <i>fleshly lusts</i>, &ldquo;They war against the soul.&rdquo;
(1 Pet. ii. 11.)&nbsp; Of <i>the world</i>, &ldquo;Love not the
world, neither the things that are in the world; if any man love
the world, the love of the Father is not in him.&rdquo; (1 John
ii. 15.)&nbsp; Of <i>the fear of man</i>, &ldquo;It bringeth a
snare.&rdquo; (Prov. xxix. 25.)&nbsp; &ldquo;The fearful and
unbelieving shall have their part in the lake which burneth with
fire and brimstone.&rdquo; (Rev. xxi. 8.)&nbsp; Of the <i>love of
ease</i>, &ldquo;If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.&rdquo; (Matt. xvi.
24.)&nbsp; Of the <i>profits or pleasures of sin</i>, &ldquo;If
thy hand offend thee, cut it off.&nbsp; If thine eye offend thee
pluck it out.&rdquo; (Mark ix. 43, 47.)&nbsp; Of <i>neglect of
salvation</i>, &ldquo;How shall we escape if we neglect so great
salvation?&rdquo; (Heb. ii. 3.)&nbsp; On this point read also
Prov. i. 24&ndash;33.</p>
<p>How striking are the examples recorded in the same
oracles!&nbsp; <i>Adam</i> risked his soul, through desire of
vain knowledge, (Gen. iii. 6.)&nbsp; <i>Cain</i>, through hatred
to true religion, (Heb. xi. 4.&nbsp; 1 John iii. 12.)&nbsp;
<i>Achan</i>, for a wedge of gold, (Josh. vii. 21.)&nbsp;
<i>Esau</i>, for a mess of pottage, (Heb. xii. 16.)&nbsp;
<i>Balaam</i>, for a reward, (Jude 11.)&nbsp; <i>Absalom</i>, for
a kingdom, (2 Sam. xv. 10.)&nbsp; <i>Ahab</i>, for a garden of
herbs, (1 Kings xxi. 4.)&nbsp; <i>Judas</i>, for thirty pieces of
silver, (Matt. xxvi. 14, 15.)&nbsp; <i>Ananias</i> and
<i>Sapphira</i>, through a lie, (Acts v. 4.)&nbsp; <i>Herod</i>,
for vain glory, (Acts xii. 22, 23.)&nbsp; <i>Pontius Pilate</i>,
for popularity, (Mark xv. 15.)&nbsp; <i>The Gentiles</i> in
general, through a dislike to retain God in their knowledge,
(Rom. i. 28.) and the <i>Jews</i>, through hypocrisy, <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>self-righteousness, and unbelief. (Matt. xvi. 3, Rom. x.
3. xi. 20.)</p>
<p>Various are the baits that are employed by the great enemy of
the human race.&nbsp; His designs are, to keep men in sin, or
draw them from true religion, or hinder their peace and
usefulness in the ways of God.&nbsp; His warlike stratagems and
subtle snares are all to catch souls. (Ephes. vi. 11. 1 Pet. v.
8.)&nbsp; Therefore, through the blessing of God, it may serve as
a guard against our danger, if we consider the following
things:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <i>The nature of the Soul</i>.&nbsp; It is spiritual,
and is designed for an eternal existence. (Gen. ii. 7.)&nbsp; It
is formed to be the residence of truth, holiness, and
happiness.&nbsp; It is capable of knowing, loving, and serving
God; (Deut. vi. 5.) and nothing can render it truly happy but
this knowledge, love, and service.&nbsp; Then how sad the
consideration that error, sin, and misery should occupy it!&nbsp;
If it lose an eternity of joy, how dreadful the reverse!&nbsp; It
cannot cease to exist.&nbsp; It cannot be annihilated.&nbsp; It
must endure positive pain.&nbsp; There is a &ldquo;worm that
dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched.&rdquo; (Mark ix.
44.)&nbsp; With what anguish will a ruined sinner cry, &ldquo;How
have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof.&rdquo;
(Prov. v. 12, 13.)&nbsp; I was warned, but I disregarded the
warning.&nbsp; I was invited, but I refused the invitation.&nbsp;
I was entreated, but I neglected the entreaty.&nbsp; I was
threatened, but I disbelieved the threatening.&nbsp; If an
occasional thought of eternity obtruded itself, it was an
unwelcome guest.&nbsp; I went to my farm, to my merchandise, to
my pleasures, to my sins; but could find no time or inclination
to go to my Bible, my Saviour, my God.&nbsp; Evil spirits have
been my tempters, they are now my companions and
tormenters.&nbsp; I am without hope; darkness and despair have
seized my Soul, &ldquo;the harvest is past, the summer is ended,
and I am not saved.&rdquo; (Jer. viii. 20.)&nbsp; My sins and
negligence are set in dread array before me, and this is their
desert.&nbsp; I see others entering into the kingdom of heaven,
but I am shut out. (Matt. xxv. 10.)&nbsp; <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>The only sound
I hear from heaven, is, <i>Eternity</i>! <i>Eternity</i>!
<i>Eternity</i>! (Rev. xiv. 10, 11.)</p>
<p>Thus, if we consider the capacity of the Soul for happiness or
misery, we may learn something of its nature and worth; and
surely this ought to serve as a guard against neglect of its
welfare.&nbsp; Shall we run into danger, and risk the loss of so
invaluable a treasure?&nbsp; Shall we be content that it should
remain doubtful whether we shall be saved or lost?&nbsp; Shall we
take such a leap in the dark, when, if we be found wrong, there
is no remedy?&nbsp; He who once loses his Soul, loses his
all.&nbsp; He is like a merchant whose ship sinks with all his
property on board.&nbsp; A man may recover many losses on earth,
but the loss of the Soul is a loss never to be repaired.&nbsp;
<i>Once lost</i>, <i>lost for ever</i>.</p>
<p>Still more shall we discover its worth, if we reflect
on:&mdash;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <i>The price of its redemption</i>.&nbsp; O! learn
the value of your Souls by that astonishing truth, &ldquo;<i>God
was manifest in the flesh</i>.&rdquo; (1 Tim. iii. 16.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became
poor.&rdquo; (2 Cor. viii. 9.)&nbsp; He became &ldquo;a man of
sorrows, and acquainted with grief.&rdquo; (Isaiah liii.
3.)&nbsp; He tabernacled thirty-three years in our evil
world.&nbsp; He was obedient to the law for man. (Dan. ix.
24.)&nbsp; He was made a sacrifice for sin. (2 Cor. v. 21.&nbsp;
Gal. iii. 13.)&nbsp; &ldquo;He was wounded for our
transgressions.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was bruised for our
iniquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He poured out his soul unto
death.&rdquo; (Isaiah liii. 5. 12.)&nbsp; By all he did and
suffered, by the mystery of his holy incarnation, by his holy
nativity and circumcision, by his baptism, fasting, and
temptation, by his agony and bloody sweat, by his cross and
passion, by his precious death and burial, by his glorious
resurrection and ascension, and by his second coming to judge the
world, an infinite dignity and incalculable value are stamped on
the Soul.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye were not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of
Christ.&rdquo; (1 Pet. i. 18, 19.)&nbsp; Shall such a price be
paid, and will you not regard your Soul?&nbsp; If immortal Souls
were so precious in the sight of God, <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>that he gave his only begotten Son,
that through him they might be saved.&nbsp; If they were so
valuable in the sight of the divine Saviour, that he did not
shrink from laying down his life for their sake, let then your
own Soul be precious in your own sight, and seek its present and
everlasting salvation through him, for he freely offers you his
salvation, yea, beseeches you to accept it at his hands. (2 Cor.
v. 20, and vi. 1.)</p>
<p>To this end, let it be your immediate object to consider,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; <i>The means appointed for the soul&rsquo;s
spiritual welfare</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ministers labour</i>
continually.&nbsp; &ldquo;They watch for your Souls as they that
must give an account.&rdquo; (Heb, xiii. 17.)&nbsp; They are the
appointed messengers of God to warn men to flee from the wrath to
come, and to invite them to lay hold on eternal life. (Col. i.
28.&nbsp; 1 Tim. vi. 12.)&nbsp; By them the blessing and the
curse are continually set before you. (Deut. xxx. 19.)&nbsp;
<i>The Gospel is preached</i>, that faith may come by hearing.
(Rom. x. 17.)&nbsp; And the spirit of God waiteth to apply it,
and make it effectual. (Isa. xxx. 18.&nbsp; Rev. iii. 20.)&nbsp;
It is brought near, and its blessings freely offered. (Rom. x.
8&ndash;13,) and the consequences of neglecting it are fully
stated. (Acts iv. 12.&nbsp; 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.)&nbsp; <i>The holy
scriptures are written</i> &ldquo;for doctrine, reproof,
correction, and instruction in righteousness.&rdquo; (2 Tim. iii.
15&ndash;17.)&nbsp; They are an infallible guide, &ldquo;a sure
word of prophecy,&rdquo; (2 Pet. i. 19,) a light to guide the
soul into the way of peace. (Ps. cxix. 105&ndash;130.)&nbsp;
<i>Conscience</i> admonishes and accuses. (Rom. ii. 15.)&nbsp;
Oftentimes, with a voice too powerful to be altogether resisted,
it whispers, &ldquo;Take heed to thy soul.&rdquo; (Acts xxiv.
25.)&nbsp; <i>Providences</i> are arranged by infinite wisdom in
such manner, that they may speak a warning voice.&nbsp; (Luke
xiii. 4.&nbsp; Mark xiii. 37.)&nbsp; <i>Afflictions</i> are sent
to awaken a concern for eternity.&nbsp; (Isaiah xxxviii.
1.)&nbsp; And the <i>Holy Spirit strives</i>, yea, condescends to
invite to a conference, with the promise of a happy result. (Gen.
vi. 3.&nbsp; Isaiah i. 18.&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Acts iii. 19.)&nbsp; <i>Destruction
has no covering</i>, that we may not fall into the pit, (Luke
xvi. 23,) and <i>Heaven darts its splendours</i> from afar to
attract the notice of immortal souls. (Ps. xvi. 11.&nbsp; Rev.
xxi. 23&ndash;27.)&nbsp; Then neglect not to use those means
which are placed within your power.&nbsp; <i>Wait on God</i>
continually. (Isa. xl. 31.)&nbsp; <i>Remember that thou keep holy
the sabbath day</i>. (Isaiah lviii. 13, 14.)&nbsp; <i>Search the
scriptures</i> daily. (Acts xvii. 11, 12.)&nbsp; <i>Be earnest in
prayer</i>.&nbsp; Cry mightily unto God, to enlighten your mind,
and renew a right spirit within you. (Luke xi. 9&ndash;13.)&nbsp;
Plead the promises of God, and you will find them faithful and
true for the welfare of your souls. (Isa. lxv. 24.)</p>
<p>Upon the whole, therefore, observe.&mdash;They who neglect the
means of grace deprive their souls of good. (Heb. iv. 1,
2.)&nbsp; They who do not reverence the Son of God and trust in
him, lose their Souls for ever. (John viii. 24.)&nbsp; In this
there is great folly, as well as guilt.&nbsp; He who is more
anxious about time than eternity, and disregards spiritual
things, is more foolish and cruel than the man, who, when his
house is on fire, looks after trifles, and exposes himself, or
leaves his child to perish in the flames.</p>
<p>Will you postpone the consideration of these things?&nbsp;
What, and if this night your soul should be required of
you?&nbsp; Be ye therefore ready. (Luke xii. 20&ndash;40.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;Behold, <i>now</i> is the accepted time, <i>now</i> is the
day of salvation.&rdquo; (2 Cor. vi. 2.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Seek ye the
Lord <i>while he may be found</i>, call ye upon him <i>while he
is near</i>;&rdquo; (Isaiah lv. 6.) lest you resemble the
<i>Roman Emperor</i> who, in his dying moments, said, &ldquo;My
poor vagrant Soul, whither art thou going;&rdquo; or the
<i>unbelieving Voltaire</i>, who declared to his physician, he
would give half his fortune to have his life lengthened half
a-year; or the <i>Jewish Rabbi</i>, who said to them that asked
him why he wept, &ldquo;If they were carrying me before a king of
flesh and blood, who is here to-day, and to-morrow in the grave;
who <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>may
bring me into bondage, but cannot keep me there, only for a
season; who may destroy my body, but cannot touch my soul, even
in these circumstances I should weep.&nbsp; But now I am going
before the King of Kings, the only blessed God, who liveth and
endureth for ever and ever, who, if I die impenitent, will
consign me to the pit whence there is no redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of being thus left, with Pagans, Infidels, and Jews,
to dread uncertainty, on a subject so amazingly important as the
future state of the immortal soul, instead of the dreadful risk
which all must run who are careless or indifferent on such a
matter, you may, by that grace of the Holy Spirit which you are
encouraged to seek, by that repentance towards God, and faith
towards our Lord Jesus Christ, which you are invited to exercise,
and which is the gift of God, be enabled to triumph over
<i>death</i>, and say, &ldquo;I know whom I have believed, and am
persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
unto him.&rdquo; (2 Tim. i. 12.)&nbsp; &ldquo;O death, where is
thy sting?&nbsp; O grave, where is thy victory?&nbsp; Thanks be
to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; (1 Cor. xv. 55.)&nbsp; You may carry your
imagination beyond the grave, and say, in the prospect of an
appearance at the <i>judgment</i> of the great day, &ldquo;Who is
he that condemneth?&nbsp; It is Christ that died.&rdquo; (Rom.
viii. 34.)&nbsp; You may look forward to <i>eternity</i>, and
say, &ldquo;I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, 1 have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me
a crown of righteousness.&rdquo; (2 Tim. iv. 6, 7.)</p>
<p>That God of his infinite mercy and love may bless you with
this grace, and lead you to the exercise of this repentance and
faith; or, if you are now penitent believers in the Lord Jesus
Christ, that you may be kept &ldquo;steadfast, immovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord,&rdquo; is the hearty desire of
the friend who thus wishes to draw your attention to the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>Worth of
your Souls</i>, by leading you to consider, <i>their nature</i>,
<i>the price of their redemption</i>, and <i>the means of their
spiritual welfare</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>What were thy gain, couldst thou survey<br />
The spacious land, and boundless sea,<br />
And view a world at thy controul,<br />
But lose thyself, th&rsquo; immortal soul?</p>
<p>Blessings of mind, or better health,<br />
Can well supply the loss of wealth:<br />
A ruin&rsquo;d soul what can restore?<br />
That loss can be repair&rsquo;d no more.</p>
<p>Where will the trembling sinner find<br />
A ransom for the guilty mind?<br />
What jewel of uncounted cost<br />
Can purchase back <i>that jewel</i> lost?</p>
<p>What madness thus to throw away<br />
A soul for trifles day by day!<br />
For dear-bought joys yourself undo,<br />
And barter bliss for certain woe!</p>
<p>Amazing folly Lord we own<br />
Our guilt, with penitential moan:<br />
While our vain hearts have been engrost,<br />
With meaner cares, our souls were lost.</p>
<p>For what in nature&rsquo;s spacious range<br />
Would happy saints their bliss exchange?<br />
Or what in time can sinners gain<br />
To balance everlasting pain?</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
