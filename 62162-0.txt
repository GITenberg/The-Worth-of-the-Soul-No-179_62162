                            WORTH OF THE SOUL.


THE soul of every man is of more worth to him than all the world.  What
would it profit him, if he were to gain the whole world, were he thereby
to lose his own Soul?  Such is the uncertainty of life, he might not long
enjoy his power, his riches, and his pleasures.  If he could possess all
these, with health and friends, and live to very old age, an eternity
then succeeds, and all that is past is but as a tale that is told, or as
a dream of the night.  For a small portion of the things of time men are
all activity and life.  They are ingenious in managing their trades,
careful in preserving their health, and watchful in securing their
property.  But should the care of the Soul be overlooked?  Should the
health of the Soul be neglected?  Should the future happiness of the Soul
be disregarded?  How many have lost their Souls through _ignorance_,
_impenitence_, _unbelief_, _disobedience_, _fleshly lusts_, _love of the
world_, _fear of man_, _love of ease_, _or some profitable or pleasant
sin_, _or neglect of the great salvation_; _yet how plain and decided are
the oracles of God on all these points_.  Observe each in its order.  On
the subject of _ignorance_, it is said, “My people are destroyed for lack
of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject
thee.” (Hos. iv. 6.)  Of _impenitence_, “Except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish.” (Luke xiii. 3.)  Of _unbelief_, “He that believeth not
the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (John
iii. 36.)  Of _disobedience_, “To them who are contentious, and do not
obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, he will render indignation and
wrath.” (Rom. ii. 8.)  Of _fleshly lusts_, “They war against the soul.”
(1 Pet. ii. 11.)  Of _the world_, “Love not the world, neither the things
that are in the world; if any man love the world, the love of the Father
is not in him.” (1 John ii. 15.)  Of _the fear of man_, “It bringeth a
snare.” (Prov. xxix. 25.)  “The fearful and unbelieving shall have their
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.” (Rev. xxi. 8.)
Of the _love of ease_, “If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” (Matt. xvi. 24.)  Of the
_profits or pleasures of sin_, “If thy hand offend thee, cut it off.  If
thine eye offend thee pluck it out.” (Mark ix. 43, 47.)  Of _neglect of
salvation_, “How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?” (Heb.
ii. 3.)  On this point read also Prov. i. 24–33.

How striking are the examples recorded in the same oracles!  _Adam_
risked his soul, through desire of vain knowledge, (Gen. iii. 6.)
_Cain_, through hatred to true religion, (Heb. xi. 4.  1 John iii. 12.)
_Achan_, for a wedge of gold, (Josh. vii. 21.)  _Esau_, for a mess of
pottage, (Heb. xii. 16.)  _Balaam_, for a reward, (Jude 11.)  _Absalom_,
for a kingdom, (2 Sam. xv. 10.)  _Ahab_, for a garden of herbs, (1 Kings
xxi. 4.)  _Judas_, for thirty pieces of silver, (Matt. xxvi. 14, 15.)
_Ananias_ and _Sapphira_, through a lie, (Acts v. 4.)  _Herod_, for vain
glory, (Acts xii. 22, 23.)  _Pontius Pilate_, for popularity, (Mark xv.
15.)  _The Gentiles_ in general, through a dislike to retain God in their
knowledge, (Rom. i. 28.) and the _Jews_, through hypocrisy,
self-righteousness, and unbelief. (Matt. xvi. 3, Rom. x. 3. xi. 20.)

Various are the baits that are employed by the great enemy of the human
race.  His designs are, to keep men in sin, or draw them from true
religion, or hinder their peace and usefulness in the ways of God.  His
warlike stratagems and subtle snares are all to catch souls. (Ephes. vi.
11. 1 Pet. v. 8.)  Therefore, through the blessing of God, it may serve
as a guard against our danger, if we consider the following things:—

I.  _The nature of the Soul_.  It is spiritual, and is designed for an
eternal existence. (Gen. ii. 7.)  It is formed to be the residence of
truth, holiness, and happiness.  It is capable of knowing, loving, and
serving God; (Deut. vi. 5.) and nothing can render it truly happy but
this knowledge, love, and service.  Then how sad the consideration that
error, sin, and misery should occupy it!  If it lose an eternity of joy,
how dreadful the reverse!  It cannot cease to exist.  It cannot be
annihilated.  It must endure positive pain.  There is a “worm that dieth
not, and a fire that is not quenched.” (Mark ix. 44.)  With what anguish
will a ruined sinner cry, “How have I hated instruction, and my heart
despised reproof.” (Prov. v. 12, 13.)  I was warned, but I disregarded
the warning.  I was invited, but I refused the invitation.  I was
entreated, but I neglected the entreaty.  I was threatened, but I
disbelieved the threatening.  If an occasional thought of eternity
obtruded itself, it was an unwelcome guest.  I went to my farm, to my
merchandise, to my pleasures, to my sins; but could find no time or
inclination to go to my Bible, my Saviour, my God.  Evil spirits have
been my tempters, they are now my companions and tormenters.  I am
without hope; darkness and despair have seized my Soul, “the harvest is
past, the summer is ended, and I am not saved.” (Jer. viii. 20.)  My sins
and negligence are set in dread array before me, and this is their
desert.  I see others entering into the kingdom of heaven, but I am shut
out. (Matt. xxv. 10.)  The only sound I hear from heaven, is, _Eternity_!
_Eternity_! _Eternity_! (Rev. xiv. 10, 11.)

Thus, if we consider the capacity of the Soul for happiness or misery, we
may learn something of its nature and worth; and surely this ought to
serve as a guard against neglect of its welfare.  Shall we run into
danger, and risk the loss of so invaluable a treasure?  Shall we be
content that it should remain doubtful whether we shall be saved or lost?
Shall we take such a leap in the dark, when, if we be found wrong, there
is no remedy?  He who once loses his Soul, loses his all.  He is like a
merchant whose ship sinks with all his property on board.  A man may
recover many losses on earth, but the loss of the Soul is a loss never to
be repaired.  _Once lost_, _lost for ever_.

Still more shall we discover its worth, if we reflect on:—

II.  _The price of its redemption_.  O! learn the value of your Souls by
that astonishing truth, “_God was manifest in the flesh_.” (1 Tim. iii.
16.)  “Though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor.” (2 Cor.
viii. 9.)  He became “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.”
(Isaiah liii. 3.)  He tabernacled thirty-three years in our evil world.
He was obedient to the law for man. (Dan. ix. 24.)  He was made a
sacrifice for sin. (2 Cor. v. 21.  Gal. iii. 13.)  “He was wounded for
our transgressions.”  “He was bruised for our iniquities.”  “He poured
out his soul unto death.” (Isaiah liii. 5. 12.)  By all he did and
suffered, by the mystery of his holy incarnation, by his holy nativity
and circumcision, by his baptism, fasting, and temptation, by his agony
and bloody sweat, by his cross and passion, by his precious death and
burial, by his glorious resurrection and ascension, and by his second
coming to judge the world, an infinite dignity and incalculable value are
stamped on the Soul.  “Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as
silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ.” (1 Pet. i. 18,
19.)  Shall such a price be paid, and will you not regard your Soul?  If
immortal Souls were so precious in the sight of God, that he gave his
only begotten Son, that through him they might be saved.  If they were so
valuable in the sight of the divine Saviour, that he did not shrink from
laying down his life for their sake, let then your own Soul be precious
in your own sight, and seek its present and everlasting salvation through
him, for he freely offers you his salvation, yea, beseeches you to accept
it at his hands. (2 Cor. v. 20, and vi. 1.)

To this end, let it be your immediate object to consider,

III.  _The means appointed for the soul’s spiritual welfare_.  _Ministers
labour_ continually.  “They watch for your Souls as they that must give
an account.” (Heb, xiii. 17.)  They are the appointed messengers of God
to warn men to flee from the wrath to come, and to invite them to lay
hold on eternal life. (Col. i. 28.  1 Tim. vi. 12.)  By them the blessing
and the curse are continually set before you. (Deut. xxx. 19.)  _The
Gospel is preached_, that faith may come by hearing. (Rom. x. 17.)  And
the spirit of God waiteth to apply it, and make it effectual. (Isa. xxx.
18.  Rev. iii. 20.)  It is brought near, and its blessings freely
offered. (Rom. x. 8–13,) and the consequences of neglecting it are fully
stated. (Acts iv. 12.  2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.)  _The holy scriptures are
written_ “for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in
righteousness.” (2 Tim. iii. 15–17.)  They are an infallible guide, “a
sure word of prophecy,” (2 Pet. i. 19,) a light to guide the soul into
the way of peace. (Ps. cxix. 105–130.)  _Conscience_ admonishes and
accuses. (Rom. ii. 15.)  Oftentimes, with a voice too powerful to be
altogether resisted, it whispers, “Take heed to thy soul.” (Acts xxiv.
25.)  _Providences_ are arranged by infinite wisdom in such manner, that
they may speak a warning voice.  (Luke xiii. 4.  Mark xiii. 37.)
_Afflictions_ are sent to awaken a concern for eternity.  (Isaiah
xxxviii. 1.)  And the _Holy Spirit strives_, yea, condescends to invite
to a conference, with the promise of a happy result. (Gen. vi. 3.  Isaiah
i. 18.  Acts iii. 19.)  _Destruction has no covering_, that we may not
fall into the pit, (Luke xvi. 23,) and _Heaven darts its splendours_ from
afar to attract the notice of immortal souls. (Ps. xvi. 11.  Rev. xxi.
23–27.)  Then neglect not to use those means which are placed within your
power.  _Wait on God_ continually. (Isa. xl. 31.)  _Remember that thou
keep holy the sabbath day_. (Isaiah lviii. 13, 14.)  _Search the
scriptures_ daily. (Acts xvii. 11, 12.)  _Be earnest in prayer_.  Cry
mightily unto God, to enlighten your mind, and renew a right spirit
within you. (Luke xi. 9–13.)  Plead the promises of God, and you will
find them faithful and true for the welfare of your souls. (Isa. lxv.
24.)

Upon the whole, therefore, observe.—They who neglect the means of grace
deprive their souls of good. (Heb. iv. 1, 2.)  They who do not reverence
the Son of God and trust in him, lose their Souls for ever. (John viii.
24.)  In this there is great folly, as well as guilt.  He who is more
anxious about time than eternity, and disregards spiritual things, is
more foolish and cruel than the man, who, when his house is on fire,
looks after trifles, and exposes himself, or leaves his child to perish
in the flames.

Will you postpone the consideration of these things?  What, and if this
night your soul should be required of you?  Be ye therefore ready. (Luke
xii. 20–40.)  “Behold, _now_ is the accepted time, _now_ is the day of
salvation.” (2 Cor. vi. 2.)  “Seek ye the Lord _while he may be found_,
call ye upon him _while he is near_;” (Isaiah lv. 6.) lest you resemble
the _Roman Emperor_ who, in his dying moments, said, “My poor vagrant
Soul, whither art thou going;” or the _unbelieving Voltaire_, who
declared to his physician, he would give half his fortune to have his
life lengthened half a-year; or the _Jewish Rabbi_, who said to them that
asked him why he wept, “If they were carrying me before a king of flesh
and blood, who is here to-day, and to-morrow in the grave; who may bring
me into bondage, but cannot keep me there, only for a season; who may
destroy my body, but cannot touch my soul, even in these circumstances I
should weep.  But now I am going before the King of Kings, the only
blessed God, who liveth and endureth for ever and ever, who, if I die
impenitent, will consign me to the pit whence there is no redemption.”

Instead of being thus left, with Pagans, Infidels, and Jews, to dread
uncertainty, on a subject so amazingly important as the future state of
the immortal soul, instead of the dreadful risk which all must run who
are careless or indifferent on such a matter, you may, by that grace of
the Holy Spirit which you are encouraged to seek, by that repentance
towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, which you are
invited to exercise, and which is the gift of God, be enabled to triumph
over _death_, and say, “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him.” (2 Tim. i.
12.)  “O death, where is thy sting?  O grave, where is thy victory?
Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus
Christ.” (1 Cor. xv. 55.)  You may carry your imagination beyond the
grave, and say, in the prospect of an appearance at the _judgment_ of the
great day, “Who is he that condemneth?  It is Christ that died.” (Rom.
viii. 34.)  You may look forward to _eternity_, and say, “I have fought a
good fight, I have finished my course, 1 have kept the faith; henceforth
there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.” (2 Tim. iv. 6, 7.)

That God of his infinite mercy and love may bless you with this grace,
and lead you to the exercise of this repentance and faith; or, if you are
now penitent believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, that you may be kept
“steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,” is the
hearty desire of the friend who thus wishes to draw your attention to the
_Worth of your Souls_, by leading you to consider, _their nature_, _the
price of their redemption_, and _the means of their spiritual welfare_.

    What were thy gain, couldst thou survey
    The spacious land, and boundless sea,
    And view a world at thy controul,
    But lose thyself, th’ immortal soul?

    Blessings of mind, or better health,
    Can well supply the loss of wealth:
    A ruin’d soul what can restore?
    That loss can be repair’d no more.

    Where will the trembling sinner find
    A ransom for the guilty mind?
    What jewel of uncounted cost
    Can purchase back _that jewel_ lost?

    What madness thus to throw away
    A soul for trifles day by day!
    For dear-bought joys yourself undo,
    And barter bliss for certain woe!

    Amazing folly Lord we own
    Our guilt, with penitential moan:
    While our vain hearts have been engrost,
    With meaner cares, our souls were lost.

    For what in nature’s spacious range
    Would happy saints their bliss exchange?
    Or what in time can sinners gain
    To balance everlasting pain?

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
